CALCULATOR_APP PROJECT  

Calculator App is a simple Python project that demonstrates the use of functions and modules.      
Different calculator operations are implemented in separate modules and imported into the main program.    
This project helps in understanding how modules work in Python.   

ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM

Developed a basic Online Banking System in Python using fundamental data structures and data types.  
The system is especially developed using user-defined modules to understand the concept of modules.  
It demonstrates core banking operations such as:  
--> Checking account balance     
--> Depositing money    
--> Withdrawing money    
--> Transferring money between accounts  
This project showcases Python basics, logic building, modular programming, and the ability to implement real-world concepts in a simple program.
